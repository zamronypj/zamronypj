# Hi I am Zamrony ðŸ‘‹


![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=zamronypj.zamronypj)

I am software developer who has interest in web development, database and game development. [My online resume](https://zamronypj.github.io) if you want to hire me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on my personal project [Fano Framework](https://fanoframework.github.io), a web framework written with Free Pascal. While developing this project, I learn network and system programming in Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and trying to improve my English by writing proper documentation for [Fano Framework documentation](https://github.com/fanoframework/fanoframework.github.io). I wrote two books by the way.
- ðŸ¤” Ask me about Fano Framework. Sometime I answer question in StackOverflow like [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14054122/associate-an-object-with-marker-google-map-v2/39122553#39122553) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48738176/constraintlayout-how-to-align-centers-of-two-views-vertically/48738272#48738272).
- I use Laravel, Slim Framework, Express, AngularJS, vue.js, React.js, Gulp. When I need RDBMS, I use MySQL or MariaDB. I like Flexbox
a lot when working with CSS. In the past, I use Delphi. When I am bored [I tinker with assembly](https://github.com/zamronypj/oprsimd/blob/master/simdssevec.pas). But right now, on my day job, mostly Golang.
- Currently I work for [Brankas](https://brankas.com) as Front-end developer.
